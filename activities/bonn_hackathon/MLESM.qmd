### Introduction

From **27–29 August 2025**, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the [CESOC Hackathon on Machine Learning for the Earth System](https://cesoc.net/hackathon-on-machine-learning-for-the-earth-system/) in Bonn, Germany.This event brought together teams interested in applying machine learning and AI techniques to solve Earth system challenges.

I was part of the **Observation / Satellite Data Challenge (Challenge 3)**, where our task was to train and finetune the AIFS model on observational precipitation data (IMERG) to improve global total precipitation forecasts.

### The Challenge

Challenge 3 required us to:

-   Work with the Anemoi framework, which provides state-of-the-art weather and climate ML models (AIFS).
-   Train and finetune AIFS model on satellite-based precipitation data (IMERG).
-   Use HPC clusters with GPU reservations to efficiently train models and run inferences for forecasting.

### Our Approach

We structured our work in three main phases:

1.  **HPC setup & baseline model testing**
    -   Reserved GPUs on HPC systems to handle computationally demanding training runs.
    -   Used the Anemoi framework to run baseline experiments with the AIFS model.
    -   Validated the model’s performance against IMERG precipitation data.
2.  **Fine-tuning with IMERG data**
    -   Integrated IMERG global precipitation datasets to improve AIFS accuracy.
    -   Conducted multiple experiments adjusting hyperparameters and loss functions.
    -   Compared global fine-tuning vs. regional fine-tuning to test adaptability.
3.  **Visualization & presentation**
    -   Developed maps and plots comparing baseline vs. finetuned outputs.
    -   Highlighted case studies of extreme precipitation events to show improvements.
    -   Packaged results into a clear, engaging presentation for the hackathon jury.

### Results & Achievements

**Key outcomes:**\
- Improved global precipitation forecasts by fine-tuning AIFS with IMERG.\
- Better detection of extreme rainfall events compared to the baseline model.

### Reflections & Learnings

Participating in this hackathon was an intense but rewarding experience. I learned to:

-   Efficiently use GPUs on HPC systems for ML training and inference.
-   Work with the Anemoi framework for weather and climate modeling.
-   Balance technical accuracy with clear communication of results.
-   Collaborate effectively in a high pressure environment.
