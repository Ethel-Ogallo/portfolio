This platform integrates spatial and temporal data, uncovering employment disparities across regions and over time. Read on to learn how this SDI was designed.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn today’s data-driven world, effective decision-making relies heavily on the ability to manage, analyze, and visualize complex datasets. A well-designed Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) enables this by integrating geospatial data across multiple sources, fostering collaboration, and supporting informed decisions.\nThis project focuses on developing an SDI tailored to Austria’s gender employment figures over a period of time. By leveraging open-source tools and technologies, the project highlights how SDIs can be applied to address pressing societal challenges, such as gender disparities in employment, while delivering actionable insights through interactive dashboards\n\n\nObjective\nThe project’s primary objective was to design a comprehensive SDI that could:\n\nCollect and integrate employment data from multiple sources, including Statistik Austria and Eurostat.\n\n\n\nDevelop web services to share geospatial data and visualizations with diverse stakeholders.\nEnable spatial analysis to identify employment trends and disparities across Austria’s urban and rural regions.\n\n\n\nSDI Architecture\nThe architecture of this SDI was designed with flexibility, accessibility, and functionality in mind, leveraging open-source tools to ensure scalability and sustainability.\n\nData Integration\n\n\nEmployment data from Statistik Austria and administrative datasets from Eurostat were standardized and stored in a PostGIS-enabled PostgreSQL database.\nData , code and project management documents can be found here: Gitlab\n\n\nOpen Geoservices\n\n\nThe project prioritized interoperability by publishing OGC-compliant web services through GeoServer and ArcGIS Server.\n\nWMS (Web Map Services) were used to provide real-time access to geospatial data.\nMetadata was managed and published using GeoNetwork, ensuring discoverability and standardization.\n\n\n\nVisualization Tools\n\n\nThe interactive dashboard was developed using Shiny apps an R-based framework for building data apps.\nIt integrates spatial and temporal datasets, providing users with:\n\nCustomizable maps highlighting gender imbalances and urban-rural disparities.\nInteractive charts and filters to explore trends by gender, region, and year.\n\n\n\nScalable Architecture\n\n\nBy using open-source software, the SDI ensures adaptability for future applications, making it a sustainable solution for ongoing spatial data challenges.\n\n\n\n\nResults\nThe interactive dashboard serves as the tangible outcome of this SDI project, showcasing its capabilities in visualizing and analyzing gender employment trends across Austria over a 10-year period.\n\nUsers can explore gender-specific disparities in employment across regions.\nThe dashboard provides dynamic visualizations that highlight temporal trends and urban-rural contrasts.\n\nExperience the Dashboard\n\nExplore the dashboard in action: Click to dashboard"

    "text": "Project 2: EO Browser for Soil Moisture Monitoring\nIntroduction\nEO Browser is a user-friendly online tool developed by Sinergise that facilitates easy access to analysis-ready satellite data, including imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel missions. It allows users to visualize and analyze environmental conditions using Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery, making Earth observation data accessible without requiring advanced technical expertise.\nIn this project, the Barren Soil Index -script developed by Monja Sebela- was applied to assess soil moisture across different regions. The Barren Soil Index leverages specific spectral bands from Sentinel-2 data to distinguish between various land cover types, such as dry soil, vegetation, and water bodies.\nAnalysis\n\n//VERSION=3 (auto-converted from 1)\n\n//Author: Monja Sebela\n\nfunction evaluatePixel(s) {\n    let val = 2.5 * ((s.B11 + s.B04)-(s.B08 + s.B02))/((s.B11 + s.B04)+(s.B08 + s.B02));\n    return [2.5* val, s.B08, s.B11];\n}\nfunction setup() {\n  return {\n    input: [{\n      bands: [\n          \"B02\",\n          \"B04\",\n          \"B08\",\n          \"B11\",\n          \"B12\"\n      ]\n    }],\n    output: { bands: 3 }\n  }\n}\n\nResults\nThe application of the Barren Soil Index was evaluated across multiple regions to assess its performance in differentiating soil moisture levels and land cover types.\nSalzburg, Austria (November 2024)\nIn Salzburg, the Barren Soil Index effectively highlighted the varying land cover types. The Salzach River was prominently displayed in black, indicating water bodies. Vegetation appeared in green, and dry soil was distinctly represented in red. The results provide a clear delineation of soil moisture variations, with the index offering valuable insights into the region’s environmental conditions.\n\nKisumu, Kenya (October 2024)\nFor Kisumu, located near Lake Victoria, the analysis revealed dry land in red, vegetation in green, and water in black. Cloud cover was indicated in blue. A noteworthy observation was that urban areas, typically associated with reflective surfaces such as concrete and asphalt, also appeared red. This similarity in spectral reflectance to dry soil suggests the utility of the Barren Soil Index in urban contexts.\n\nBarbados (November 2024)\nIn Barbados, the index highlighted barren soil in red, vegetation in green, water in black, and cloud cover in a bluish-green hue. An interesting feature of the analysis was the appearance of a red boundary over the ocean. This could potentially be attributed to underlying dry soil on nearby islands or the influence of sensor angle, providing an additional layer of insight into the interaction between atmospheric and land features in coastal areas.\n\nConclusion\nThis analysis demonstrates the practical application of EO Browser , with the Barren Soil Index for monitoring soil moisture variations, across diverse geographical regions. The results underscore the efficacy of satellite-based remote sensing tools in environmental monitoring, particularly in the context of soil moisture and vegetation health assessment.\nBy utilizing Sentinel-2 imagery and advanced spectral analysis, this study illustrates the growing importance of remote sensing techniques in sustainable land management and climate monitoring. The ability to monitor land surface conditions on a global scale provides invaluable support for decision-making in agriculture, urban planning, and disaster management."

    "text": "Project 3: Leveraging Sen2Cube for Seasonal Water Monitoring\nWhat Are DataCubes?\nA DataCube is a multi-dimensional array of data, typically used for storing and analyzing large amounts of Earth Observation (EO) satellite imagery. DataCubes facilitate efficient access to spatiotemporal data by organizing satellite imagery into a structure that enables fast querying and analysis over time.\nSen2Cube\nSen2Cube, developed by the Department of Geoinformatics - Z_GIS at the University of Salzburg ,provides a unique and accessible approach to satellite data analysis. It allows users to generate actionable insights from satellite imagery with a higher semantic level providing users with an intuitive web-based platform to formulate queries and analyze satellite data.\nThe Simple Water Count Model\nFor this analysis, the Simple Water Count model was employed to assess the seasonality of water bodies across several Austrian lakes. This model was specifically chosen for its ability to detect water presence in satellite imagery over time, making it ideal for tracking fluctuations in water levels. The model was adapted not only to monitor water presence over time but also to visualize spatial variations of water bodies.\nBy applying this model, users can calculate water counts across different seasons and identify temporal trends of water bodies. The model produces two main outputs: a graphical representation of water presence over time and a spatial map showing the distribution of water across defined periods.\nResults: Seasonal Variations Across Austrian Lakes\nThe model was applied to four lakes in Austria: Neusiedler See, Ossiacher See, Plansee/Heiterwanger See, and Ottensteiner Stausee. The results, based on the analysis of Sentinel-2 imagery, provided valuable insights into the seasonal changes in water presence across these water bodies.\n1. Neusiedler See\n\nGraphical Results: The graph revealed that Neusiedler See showed significant seasonal variation in water presence. Higher water counts were observed during the early months (February-March) and later months (November), suggesting an increase in water levels. Conversely, July-September saw a reduction in water levels, possibly due to seasonal evaporation or cloud cover interference.\nSpatial Analysis: The spatial map showed a clear reduction in water coverage over time. Lighter hues indicated areas of water, while darker hues represented non-water areas.\n\n\n2. Ossiacher See\n\nGraphical Results: Ossiacher See displayed a consistent water presence over time, with a brief period showing a 0 water count, likely due to cloud cover obstructing satellite observations.\nSpatial Analysis: The spatial map showed minimal changes in water coverage, confirming the stability of water levels at Ossiacher See.\n\n\n3. Plansee/Heiterwanger See\n\nGraphical Results: The graph for Plansee/Heiterwanger See indicated a decrease in water presence between May and June, likely due to seasonal drying. November to March showed 0 water count values, which may have been caused by high cloud cover.\nSpatial Analysis: The spatial map corroborated the seasonal variation observed in the graph, with lighter values indicating water presence and darker shades showing reduced coverage.\n\n\n4. Ottensteiner Stausee\n\nGraphical Results: Ottensteiner Stausee exhibited seasonal fluctuations in water presence, particularly between March and July. The reduction in water levels during this period suggests it is a seasonal water body.\nSpatial Analysis: Similar to the other lakes, the spatial map displayed a reduction in water coverage, confirming the seasonal nature of Ottensteiner Stausee."

Segmentation is required for clustering pixels into significant objects in order to facilitate a more structured classification process. Segmentation considers spatial context, unlike pixel-based classification, and is therefore particularly useful for delineating complex land cover types.\nTo produce meaningful image objects, a Multiresolution Segmentation algorithm within eCogniton was employed. A scale parameter of 150 was set such that resulting segments are not too small nor too large, finding a compromise between detail preservation and efficiency in classification. This segmentation was key in distinguishing between land cover classes, dividing the image/scene into objects based on their spectral value, shape and compactness.\n\n\n\nmultiresolution segmentation\n\n\n\n\nSample-based Image classification\nWhy Sample-Based Classification? Supervised classification applies training data to develop a model that can generalize to unseen areas. By selecting representative samples, we ensure the classification model is able to separate land cover categories effectively.\nA supervised classification method was utilized, and a selection of representative samples for the major land cover categories were needed:Water, Grassland, Forest, Bare Soil, and Impervious Surfaces (streets, buildings, etc.)\nThe classification used mean spectral values from the image bands to separate classes. Training was done using a Support Vector Machine (SVM), iteratively refining the classification by adjusting training samples and re-running the classification.\n\n\n\nsupervised classification"

Two segmentation approaches were used:\n\nChessboard Segmentation: This method creates uniform grid-based objects, which is useful for initial feature assessment. This method is not suitable for distinguishing meaningful land cover features. A comparison of segmented objects, such as a ship and water for example, revealed:\n\nThe NDVI for water is negative due to its low near-infrared (NIR) reflectance and high visible reflectance and the ship exhibits higher reflectance across all bands, likely due to its surface color.\nHowever, because all segments are of equal size, the segmentation does not align well with natural object boundaries, making it unsuitable for this classification task.\n\n\n\n\nMultiresolution Segmentation: This technique groups pixels into meaningful objects based on spectral and spatial properties.

    "section": "Workflow",
    "text": "Workflow\nTo understand the ground deformation, I utilized Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) techniques. Here’s a breakdown of my workflow:\n\na. Data preparation\nData was downloaded from the ASF data research vertex of the study area before the volcanic eruption of May 22nd, 2021. The before eruption image is May 13th 2021, and the after image is May 25th 2021. The data was then loaded into SNAP as below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 loaded sentinel 1 SLC images before and after volcanic eruption.\n\n\nWithin SNAP, I performed a TOPS split for each image, focusing on the IW1 sub-swath with VV polarization and bursts 1 to 5, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the study area. Following this, orbit files were applied to both split images to refine their geometric accuracy.\n\n\nb. Generation of topographic interferogram\nThe next critical step was coregistration, where the before-eruption image (May 13th) was set as the master and the after-eruption image (May 25th) as the slave. The SRTM DEM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model) was incorporated to account for terrain variations.\nInitial interferogram generation revealed significant noise, particularly in the phase image, making fringes (which indicate displacement) less visible. However, the coherent image clearly highlighted coherent zones, areas where the radar signal remained consistent between the two acquisition dates. To improve the signal, TOPSAR debursting was applied to the interferometric phase.\n\nFigure 2 shows a) coherent product and b) interferometric phase after deburst.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc. Creating the Differential Interferogram\nTo isolate the displacement signal, topographic phase removal was performed. This step subtracts the topographic contribution from the interferometric phase, leaving only the deformation component.\nFollowing this, multilooking was applied to reduce speckle noise and improve the visual quality of the interferometric images. Finally, Goldstein phase filtering was used to further enhance the phase signal, making the displacement fringes much clearer and interpretable. The comparison between the images before and after filtering clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of this step.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows the side-by-side comparison a) before filtering and b) after filtering.\n\n\n\n\nd. Generating the Displacement Map\nThe filtered interferogram was then exported to SNAPHU for phase unwrapping. This process converts the wrapped phase (which ranges from −π to π) into a continuous, absolute phase, directly proportional to ground displacement. The unwrapped product was then imported back into SNAP.\nThe final step involved converting the unwrapped phase into a displacement map. This involved a “Phase to Displacement” operation within SNAP, which translates the phase changes into actual ground movement values.\n\n\n\nFigure 4 shows a) the unwrapped product and b) the displacement image."

    "text": "Location: Benicàssim, Spain\nHost: University of Jaume I\nProject : NextCity\nDate : June 3–6, 2025\nIn June 2025, I participated in the NextCity Summer School and Thematic Workshop, a program combining theory and hands-on experience in digital twins, GeoAI and 3D GIS. Hosted in the beautiful town of Benicàssim, Spain, and organized under the NextCity project, the event brought together students, researchers, and professionals to explore the future of urban innovation.\n\nJun 3-4 : Summer school : Concepts & Theory\nThe first two days of the summer school were on the theoretical aspect of Digital Twins and smart city technologies.\nDay 1 – Technologies and tools for developing digital twins\nThe first day of the summer school, led by Florian Fischer (Esri Germany), was on understanding the technologies that develop digital twin systems, with a focus on reality mapping, real-time data integration, and 3D model generation using ESRI tools ArcGIS Reality for ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Reality Studio.\nWe began by exploring aerial triangulation and dense image matching techniques, which form the basis of accurate 3D reconstruction. These methods enable the generation of high-resolution spatial models from overlapping images, ensuring both precision and realism. A particularly fascinating component was the process of 3D-mesh generation, where algorithms automatically filter out moving objects, resulting in clean urban representations, essential for maintaining consistency in urban simulations.\nAnother advanced rendering technique presented was the use of Gaussian splats, an innovative approach for visualizing complex 3D environments with photorealistic quality, particularly effective when modeling natural textures or urban facades. In parallel, we also examined the availability and value of open lidar datasets, such as those made publicly accessible in the Netherlands, which highlight how national-level open data policies can support digital twin innovation.\nCollectively, these technologies demonstrated how spatial data, when combined with the right analytical tools, can be transformed into dynamic, high-resolution urban models. These models serve not only as visual representations but also as data-rich platforms for analysis, simulation, and real-time decision-making.\nDay 2 – AI and prediction in Digital Twins\nThe second day of the summer school was on the integration of AI in the digital twin ecosystem. Led by Minerva Centeno from Esri Spain, the morning session introduced GeoAI, highlighting how machine learning and spatial analysis are converging to enhance decision-making and automate workflows in geospatial applications.\nA central focus was the use of deep learning within ArcGIS, particularly in generating unbiased True Ortho imagery. Instead of relying solely on traditional datasets like OpenStreetMap (OSM), models were trained using Digital Surface Models (DSM) and slope data, reducing potential bias and improving accuracy in height-sensitive environments. Several key geoprocessing tools were explored, including Slope, Extract by Attribute, and Raster Solar Radiation, demonstrating their utility in preparing data for AI pipelines.\nWe also looked into multi-resolution Level of Detail (LOD) modeling, covering a range from LOD 0 to 3.5. This was contextualized with real-world case studies, such as Hungary’s LOD2 initiative which showcased national-scale 3D data production for planning and governance.\nA portion of the session was dedicated to the integration of open-source AI libraries into ArcGIS, GEOAI, a framework that blends spatial thinking with cutting-edge machine learning tools. We examined the use of pre-trained models, including practical considerations like batch size, cell resolution, and change detection. Among the tools discussed were Text SAM (Segment Anything Model), Grounding DINO + SAM for text-guided segmentation, and techniques for crop classification from time series data, all pointing toward more intelligent and adaptable geospatial systems.\nIn the afternoon, Joep Crompvoets from KU Leuven led an intriguing session on the impacts of 3D and AI-driven systems. His discussion went beyond the technical to address digital governance in geospatial systems, emphasizing the need for frameworks that evolve with intelligent technologies. A compelling debate emerged around the question: “AI — hype or hit?” This led to an exploration of the philosophical divide between Symbolic AI and Connectionist (Machine Learning) AI, and the growing efforts to integrate both schools for more powerful systems. Key governance takeaways included the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and balancing innovation with responsibility in designing future-ready digital infrastructures.\n\n\nJun 5-6: Thematic Workshop: From Theory to Practice\nThe second half of the program was dedicated to applying what we had learned in a hands-on environment.\nDay 3 – Fundamentals in 3D modelling\nLed by Adrián Bautista (University of Jaume I), we focused on the process of Blenderization, the preparation and simplification of 3D models for use in GIS environments. We began by working with CAD models, which we imported into Blender to clean and optimize for GIS workflows. These models were then georeferenced and visualized in ArcGIS Pro, transforming raw architectural data into functional, spatially aware 3D objects. This workflow showcased how design and geospatial technologies converge in the digital twin pipeline.\nWe also explored ArcGIS Indoors, introduced by Nicolás Luna (Univ. Jaume I), to understand how interior spatial planning plays a role in smart environments. This tool enables the visualization and management of indoor spaces, setting the foundation for digital twin solutions.\nDay 4 – Indoor Mapping & Smart Apps Development\nA continuation of the previous day session led by Nicolás Luna (Univ. Jaume I), we extended our skills into indoor network analysis. We built indoor networks within a 3D building model using ArcGIS Network Analyst, simulating realistic routing scenarios , particularly relevant for large-scale indoor environments like airports, hospitals, or shopping malls. We then published our results to ArcGIS Online and developed an interactive web application combining 2D and 3D maps, effectively communicating complex spatial relationships within buildings.\n\n\nOur Hands-On Output:\n\n\n\nA detailed 3D model of a building we developed during the workshop – showcasing the full workflow from data to 3D visualization in ArcGIS Pro.\n\n\n\n\nReflection\nParticipating in the summer school was a very enriching experience that offered both technical depth and real-world perspective. We explored the latest advancements in GIS, AI, and digital twin technologies, gaining hands-on experience with tools like ArcGIS Reality, Blender, and ArcGIS Indoors.\nThese exercises were not only technically rich, but also provided a glimpse into real-world implementations. A good example was the digital twin of the University of Jaume I campus , currently under development as part of their smart campus initiative. This living model illustrates how digital twins can support campus management, operations, and strategic planning. Additionally, we learned about the NextCity project’s vision to develop a regional-scale digital twin for Lisbon’s ZER region, underscoring the increasing scale and importance of these technologies in urban and regional planning.\nFor me, this was a foundational introduction to 3D mapping and digital twin workflows. The combination of expert-led lectures and immersive practical sessions helped bridge the gap between theory and application. Most importantly, it initiated new ideas for applying digital twin concepts to simulate Earth Observation scenarios such as flooding, wildfire and landcover for monitoring.\nMany thanks to the NextCity project and all its partners for organizing this summer school. I would highly recommend this program to anyone interested in geospatial technology, AI, or smart city development as another edition is planned for next year, potentially in Belgium or Portugal where the partner universities are located (look out for their announcement for the location).\n\n\nThe University of Jaume I digital twin\n\nCertificate of participation:\n\nMoments captured throughout the enriching “Next City” summer school.\n \n\nImage 1: Nicole Salazar and me (CDE students present)\nImage 2: With other EMJM+ students (the Geotech program)"
