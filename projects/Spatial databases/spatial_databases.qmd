## **Context**

As part of a fictional project for Vudstork Entertainment Ltd, I was tasked with developing a WebGIS backend to support a mobile app for a city festival. The app provides festival visitors with real-time information and allows organizers to distribute notifications and streamline their workflows. My role involved leveraging my Geoinformatics expertise to design and implement a spatial database, which forms the core of the app’s functionality, integrating various methods and software techniques learned during the semester.

**Requirements**

-   Serve as database backend to organise the booths, roller coasters, tents etc. (Positions, opening times) as well as other facilities (garbage bins, toilets etc)
-   User-specific, dynamic queries that return which events take place or facilities that are close to the current visitor’s position.
-   User-specific and dynamic queries about the festival (digital maps, lists of events etc

### **DDL,DML steps**

essentially the all the steps to set up the database, breakdown by tasks sudmanns has. I guess break it down to DDL, DML and DCL
