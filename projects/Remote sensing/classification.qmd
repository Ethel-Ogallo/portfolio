## **Introduction**

### **Objective**

This project involves performing a supervised and knowledge based land cover classification of a satellite imagery to identify key land cover classes and further refine the classification using expert rules.

### **Study Area and Data**

-   Study Area: Kelleys Island, USA.

-   Datasets Used:

    ![](images/clipboard-1316435109.png)

    -   Planet Dove satellite image subset (3m resolution, 4 bands: Blue, Green, Red, Near-Infrared).

    -   Flood Zone Raster (3m resolution, binary values: 1 = potential flood zone, 0 = no flood zone).

-   Software Used: eCognition Developer 10.3.

### **Supervised Classification**

#### Image segmentation

Multiresolution Segmentation algorithm in eCognition was applied to create meaningful image objects. A Scale parameter of â€”- was chosen to balance fine-grained details with classification needs.\*\*

#### Image classification

Sample Selection: Collected representative samples for the following land cover classes:

-   Water

-   Grassland

-   Forest

-   Bare Soil

-   Impervious Surfaces (streets, buildings, etc.)

-add image of sample and classes here

Feature Selection: Used mean spectral values as classification features.

Supervised Classification: Applied an SVM

Iterative Refinement: Adjusted training samples and re-ran classification to improve accuracy.

### **Knowledge-Based Classification**

Adding Subclasses:

New Classes:Forest_Flooded (flooded forest areas) and Lake (subset of the Water class).

Rule-Based Classification:

Used the "Assign Class" algorithm to classify "Forest_Flooded" where forest objects overlapped with flood zone pixels (value = 1).

Identified "Lake" within the island using geometry-based conditions (e.g., "Find Enclosed by Class").

Post-Processing:

Merged water objects to ensure proper lake classification.

Applied further refinement rules where necessary.

Calculated Shape Index of the Lake Object

### **High-Level Segmentation**

New Segmentation Level: Created a coarse segmentation level for the island.

Multiresolution Segmentation:

Used only spectral bands for segmentation.

Increased scale parameter to group the entire island as one object. Iterative Testing:Adjusted parameters to achieve desired segmentation.
