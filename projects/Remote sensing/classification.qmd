## **Introduction**

The project consists of conducting a supervised and knowledge-based land cover classification of a sample of satellite imagery. An object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach is used in the initial steps, applying spectral and spatial attributes to segment and classify the land cover using eCognition.

**Study Area and Data**

Kelleys Island, located in the United States, serves as the study area for this analysis. The datasets used include:

-   **Planet Dove Satellite Image** (3m resolution, 4 bands: Blue, Green, Red, Near-Infrared), providing detailed spectral information for classification.

-   **Flood Zone Raster** (3m resolution, binary values: 1 = potential flood zone, 0 = no flood zone), used for knowledge-based classification to refine land cover identification.

## **Supervised Classification**

### **Image segmentation**

**Why Image Segmentation?** Segmentation is required for clustering pixels into significant objects in order to facilitate a more structured classification process. Segmentation considers spatial context, unlike pixel-based classification, and is therefore particularly useful for delineating complex land cover types.

To produce meaningful image objects, a *Multiresolution Segmentation* algorithm within eCogniton was employed. A scale parameter of 150 was set such that resulting segments are not too small nor too large, finding a compromise between detail preservation and efficiency in classification. This segmentation was key in distinguishing between land cover classes, dividing the image/scene into objects based on their spectral value, shape and compactness.

### **Sample-based Image classification**

**Why Sample-Based Classification?** Supervised classification applies training data to develop a model that can generalize to unseen areas. By selecting representative samples, we ensure the classification model is able to separate land cover categories effectively.

A supervised classification method was utilized, and a selection of representative samples for the major land cover categories were needed:Water, Grassland, Forest, Bare Soil, and Impervious Surfaces (streets, buildings, etc.)

The classification used mean spectral values from the image bands to separate classes. Training was done using a *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*, iteratively refining the classification by adjusting training samples and re-running the classification.

## **Knowledge-Based Classification**

**Why Knowledge-Based Classification?** Supervised classification incorrectly classifies some regions and provides only a broad classification. Knowledge-based classification applies expert rules and other data sources to limit the results, hence improving overall accuracy.

Whereas the first classification provided a general class of land cover, expert knowledge was incorporated to provide more detail results. Two new classes were incorporated:

-   Forest_Flooded: Areas classified as forest that overlap with flood-prone zones.

-   Lake: A subclass of water, distinguishing inland water bodies from surrounding waters.

### **Applying Expert Rules**

The *Assign Class* algorithm was used to identify and classify Forest_Flooded areas. This rule-based classification ensured that any forest object intersecting flood-prone zones (value = 1 in the flood zone raster) was correctly labeled.

Similarly, in order to classify Lake areas correctly, the *Find Enclosed by Class* algorithm was used. The algorithm could successfully find inland water bodies based on geometric properties, which ensured water bodies within the island were well classified.

### **Post-Processing**

To further improve results, the Merge Region algorithm was used to combine fragmented water objects into one object, ensuring precise representation of the lake class.

The final knowledge-based classification incorporated these enhancements, yielding a better land cover representation.

## **High-Level Segmentation**

**Why High-Level Segmentation?** High-level segmentation allows for analysis at a broader scale, grouping larger regions to gain insights into overall land cover patterns.

To further analyze the island at a broader level, a new segmentation level was introduced. The goal was to segment the entire island as a single object, allowing for higher-level classification and analysis.

**Coarse-Level Segmentation**

A second segmentation was also performed using only the spectral bands, increasing the scale parameter significantly to encompass the entire island as a single object. Several iterations were performed to fine-tune the scale so that the island would be segmented as a single unit without fragmentation.

The result successfully separated the island as a single object, demonstrating how various scales of segmentation can be used for various analysis purposes.

## **Conclusion**

This project applied a systematic process to land cover classification, combining supervised and knowledge-based methods to eCognition. The processing methodology emphasized segmentation, feature selection, and interactive optimization as a critical component to providing useful classification. Adding knowledge enhanced the following classification even further, with more accurate and insightful land cover for Kelleys Island. High-level segmentation with resulting maps provided the analysis with a macro level, with possibilities of larger regional analysis as well as ongoing spatial assessment.
