## **Introduction**

The classification of remote sensing imagery has traditionally relied on pixel-based analysis, which considers spectral values . However, object-based classification provides a more advanced approach by incorporating shape, texture, and contextual relationships.

This study explores the segmentation and classification process applied to a Quickbird image of Salzburg and pseudo airquality image, using **eCognition** software to extract meaningful features for classification.

## **Segmentation**

Segmentation is a fundamental step in object-based image analysis. Two segmentation approaches were used:

1.  **Chessboard Segmentation**: This method creates uniform grid-based objects, which is useful for initial feature assessment. This method is not suitable for distinguishing meaningful land cover features. A comparison of segmented objects, such as a ship and water for example, revealed:

    -   The NDVI for water is negative due to its low near-infrared (NIR) reflectance and high visible reflectance and the ship exhibits higher reflectance across all bands, likely due to its surface color.

    -   However, because all segments are of equal size, the segmentation does not align well with natural object boundaries, making it unsuitable for this classification task.

-   **Multiresolution Segmentation**: This technique groups pixels into meaningful objects based on spectral and spatial properties. It is more suited for real-world classification as it captures object boundaries more accurately.

## Feature Selection and Object Analysis

Object features play a crucial role in classification. The key categories of features examined in this study include:

-   **Spectral Features**: Mean and maximum pixel values per band.

-   **Geometrical Features**: Shape index and object area.

-   **Textural Features**: Haralick-based texture measures.

-   **Hierarchical Features**: Relationships between super-objects and sub-objects.

-   **Class-Related Features**: Proximity to specific classified objects

### Classification

**Step 1: NDVI Calculation**

To classify vegetation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was computed using:

**NDVI = (NIR-Red)/(NIR+Red)**

Objects with NDVI values above 0.25 were classified as vegetation, while those below -0.15 were classified as water bodies.

**Step 2: Assigning Object Classes**

Using the “Assign Class” algorithm:

-   Vegetation was classified using the NDVI threshold.

-   Water bodies were extracted based on low NDVI values.

-   A "Boat" class was assigned using the "Relative Border to Water" feature, identifying objects completely surrounded by water.

**Step 3: Integrating Air Quality Data**

The air quality raster layer was used to refine the vegetation class:

-   Vegetation was split into **high-air-quality** (in the image light blue color) and **low-air-quality** (in the image below green color) areas based on pixel values from the air quality dataset.

-   This created subclasses, allowing for a more detailed environmental analysis.

## Hierarchical classification

To refine object classification, hierarchical segmentation was applied by creating a lower-level segmentation from an existing level using multiresolution segmentation with a smaller scale parameter. This approach enhances detail by generating smaller objects, capturing fine structures such as individual trees, buildings, or narrow water bodies. The multi-level segmentation enables a hierarchical classification process, allowing for the refinement of class boundaries and improving overall classification accuracy.

## Conclusion

The object-based approach provided improved classification accuracy compared to pixel-based methods.

-   The multiresolution segmentation effectively delineated meaningful objects, making the classification more representative of real-world features.

-   Feature-based classification allowed for the differentiation of vegetation, water, and built-up areas, enhancing thematic mapping.

-   The use of multiple scale parameters enabled hierarchical classification, ensuring different levels of detail could be incorporated into the analysis.

-   The integration of air quality data demonstrated how multi-source information can refine classifications, making results more applicable to environmental studies.
