description: "This project employs Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) to assess building density patterns, focusing on the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya. Utilizing high-resolution drone imagery, OBIA segments the buildings which are then analyzed to estimate building density, providing insights into settlement patterns. The findings, presented in a scientific poster format, demonstrate OBIA's effectiveness in spatial analysis applications within complex environments."
