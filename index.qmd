Hi! Iâ€™m Ethel, a geospatial and data science enthusiast with a background in Geoinformatics and an interest in leveraging AI in Earth Observation to solve real-world challenges. I am currently undertaking the Copernicus Master in Digital Earth ([CDE](https://master-cde.eu/)), specializing in GeoDataScience, at both the University of Salzburg and University of South Brittany in Vannes . This master's degree is funded by the Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Programme.

In this portfolio, you will find a collection of my academic projects and other relevant work and research that showcase my journey and growth in Earth Observation and GeoDataScience.
