Hi! I am Ethel, a data science professional with a background in Geinformatics. I am currently undertaking the Copernicus Master in Digital Earth ([CDE](https://master-cde.eu/)), specializing in GeoDataScience, at both the University of Salzburg and University of South Brittany in Vannes . This master's degree is fully funded by the Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Programme.

In this portfolio, you will find a collection of my academic projects and other relevant work and research that showcases my journey and growth in Earth Observation and GeoDataScience.
