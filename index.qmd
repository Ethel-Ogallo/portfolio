Hi there!

I’m a geospatial and data science enthusiast from Kenya with a background in Geoinformatics. I’m interested in using AI and Earth Observation to tackle real-world challenges.

Currently I am pursuing the Copernicus Master in Digital Earth ([CDE](https://master-cde.eu/)), specializing in GeoDataScience, at both the University of Salzburg in Austria and University of South Brittany in France. This master's degree is funded by the Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Programme.

This portfolio is a collection of my academic projects, research, and other relevant work during my master’s journey. It will be continuously updated as I take on new projects.

Feel free to explore!
